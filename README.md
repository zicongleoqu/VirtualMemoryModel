# virtualmemorymodel
• Designed and implemented a hash table data structure in C++ to emulate virtual memory
• Users can insert or delete key/value pairs and then search for the memory address of a given key
• Modeled both open addressing and chaining to resolve collisions and optimize data retrieval
• Achieved constant-time complexity under uniform hashing
